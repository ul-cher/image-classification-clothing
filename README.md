# Project: Fashion Image Classification

This project demonstrates the process of classifying fashion images using Transfer Learning. Started by training a model on the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset and fine-tuned it on the more complex **Fashion Product Images Dataset**.

## Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraged a pre-trained model on Fashion-MNIST.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied random transformations to increase data diversity.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Unfrozen part of the model layers and fine-tuned it.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved **92.63%** accuracy on the test dataset.

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Achievements
- Successfully applied Transfer Learning to accelerate model training.
- Implemented data augmentation to increase training data diversity.
- Fine-tuned the model, improving accuracy from 82.46% to 92.63%.
- Visualized training results using accuracy/loss plots and a confusion matrix.
